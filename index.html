            An Excerpt From the Life of Samuel Johnson
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>His Vanity of Human Wishes has less of common life, 
                but more of a philosophick dignity than his London. More readers, therefore,
                 will be delighted with the pointed spirit of London, than with the profound
                  reflection of The Vanity of Human Wishes. Garrick, for instance, 
                observed in his sprightly manner, with more vivacity than regard to just discrimination, 
                as is usual with wits: 'When Johnson lived much with the Herveys, 
                and saw a good deal of what was passing in life, he wrote his London, which is lively and easy. 
                When he became more retired, he gave us his Vanity of Human Wishes, which is as hard as Greek. 
                Had he gone on to imitate another satire, it would have been as hard as Hebrew.'</p>

           <p>Garrick being now vested with theatrical power by being manager of Drury-lane theatre, he kindly an generously made use of it to bring out Johnson's tragedy, 
            which had been long kept back for want of encouragement. But in this benevolent purpose he met with no small difficulty from the temper of Johnson,
            which could not brook that a drama which he had formed with much study, and had been obliged to keep more than the nine years of Horace, 
            should be revised and altered at the pleasure of an actor. Yet Garrick knew well, that without some alterations it would not be fit for the stage. 
            A violent dispute having ensued between them, Garrick applied to the Reverend Dr. Taylor to interpose. Johnson was at first very obstinate.
            'Sir, (said he) the fellow wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels.
            ' He was, however, at last, with difficulty, prevailed on to comply with Garrick's wishes, so as to allow of some changes; but still there were not enough.</p>

           <p>Dr. Adams was present the first night of the representation of Irene, and gave me the following account: 'Before the curtain drew up, there were catcalls whistling,
           which alarmed Johnson's friends. The Prologue, which was written by himself in a manly strain, soothed the audience, and the play went off tolerably, till 
           it came to the conclusion, when Mrs. Pritchard, the heroine of the piece, was to be strangled upon the stage, and was to speak two lines with the bowstring 
            round her neck. The audience cried out "Murder! Murder!" She several times attempted to speak; but in vain. At last she was obliged to go off the stage alive.
           ' This passage was afterwards struck out, and she was carried off to be put to death behind the scenes, as the play now has it. The Epilogue, as Johnson informed
           me, was written by Sir William Yonge. I know not how his play came to be thus graced by the pen of a person then so eminent in the political world.</p>

           <p>Notwithstanding all the support of such performers as Garrick, Barry, Mrs. Cibber, Mrs. Pritchard, and every advantage of dress and decoration, the tragedy
             of Irene did not please the publick. Mr. Garrick's zeal carried it through for nine nights, so that the authour had his three nights' profits; 
             and from a receipt signed by him, now in the hands of Mr. James Dodsley, it appears that his friend Mr. Robert Dodsley gave him one hundred pounds
              for the copy, with his usual reservation of the right of one edition.</p>
